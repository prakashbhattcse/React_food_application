 # Cart Slice

- This file defines the Redux slice for the cart. A slice includes the reducer and actions for a specific feature of the applicationâ€”in this case, the cart.

- *initialState*: The initial state of cart is loaded from localStorage.If there are no items in localStorage,it defaults to an empty array.

- *reducers*: This object defines the reducer functions for the cart. Each function takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state.

*addItem*: Adds an item to the cart and saves the new cart to localStorage.

*removeItem*: Removes an item from the cart and saves the new cart to localStorage.

*clearCart* : Clears all items from the cart and removes the cart from localStorage. 

# When an item is added to the cart, the addItem action is dispatched. In the reducer for this action, after the item is added to the state, the updated state is saved to localStorage.

- Similarly, when an item is removed or the cart is cleared, the updated state (after removal of items or clearing) is saved to localStorage. 

- On initial load of the application, the cart items are loaded from localStorage into the initial state of the Redux store.
